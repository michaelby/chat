# chat

This is a basic chat app done as an exercise to practice Mongo, Express, Angular and Node. It is not pretty, well-tested, well-commented or production-ready, but I think it showcases quite nicely what you can do with these technologies in a couple of days.

MongoDB and Node.js are required to run it. Run

    $ npm install
    $ npm start
 
and browse to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). It's nice to use a private browsing session to log in as a separate user and see how both users' unread message counts change as they post messages to each other.
